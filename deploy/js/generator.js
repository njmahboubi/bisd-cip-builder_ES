    "P016": "This document is designed to function as the campus working source for Plan4Learning. BISD pre-populates the common CNA narrative, strengths, problem statements, root causes, goals, strategies, action steps, owners, evidence, and review cadence. Before the plan is sent to the campus, the district should also pre-populate campus identifiers and any metrics already available from confirmed TEA or district sources. Campus leaders should update only the remaining blue-shaded metric fields, review the completed plan for accuracy, and then COPY AND PASTE the finished content into the matching Plan4Learning fields.",
    "P017": "Campus leader task: Complete only the remaining blue-shaded metric fields. Do not rewrite the common district language. After all metrics are confirmed, COPY AND PASTE the completed content section-by-section into Plan4Learning.",
    "P024": "This campus serves students in elementary grade levels within Beaumont ISD and operates within a districtwide transformation model centered on instructional excellence, leadership density, and operational coherence. The campus community includes students from multiple racial/ethnic groups and special populations, including economically disadvantaged students, emergent bilingual students, students receiving special education services, and students who may experience mobility or attendance barriers. Campus planning will disaggregate academic, attendance, behavior, and implementation outcomes by student group so that supports can be differentiated while maintaining a common instructional model. The campus will use current TEA, PEIMS, attendance, staffing, and local assessment data to monitor whether all students have equitable access to grade-level instruction and acceleration.",
    "P053": "The campus is supported by a coherent districtwide instructional and school-effectiveness model rather than a collection of disconnected campus initiatives.",
    "P054": "District systems provide common expectations for curriculum, lesson preparation, formative assessment, observation, coaching, attendance, student support, and leadership routines.",
    "P055": "Campus leaders have access to district and campus data that can be disaggregated by student group and used to identify students requiring additional academic, attendance, or behavioral support.",
    "P058": "Student needs vary across demographic and special-population groups, requiring differentiated support while maintaining consistent access to strong Tier 1 instruction.",
    "P060": "Variation in attendance, mobility, academic readiness, language needs, disability status, and other student factors increases the need for consistent progress monitoring and rapid assignment of targeted supports.",
    "P063": "Staffing stability and adult capacity can constrain sustained improvement at high-need campuses.",
    "P065": "Vacancies, certification gaps, variation in teacher experience/effectiveness, and inconsistent access to differentiated coaching can limit reliable implementation of the BISD instructional model.",
    "P070": "Student learning priorities are anchored in Beaumont ISD Board Outcome Goals for Grade 3 Reading and Mathematics and in the district expectation that strong PK-2 foundational literacy and numeracy prepare students for Grade 3 success. The campus will use STAAR, district/local assessments, Demonstrations of Learning, progress-monitoring measures, student work, and subgroup data to identify strengths, gaps, and required instructional responses. Campus data reviews will connect student outcomes to evidence of curriculum implementation, PLC preparation, differentiation, intervention, and coaching.",
    "P093": "The district has established a common instructional model with clear expectations for curriculum, lesson preparation, gradual release, engagement, DOL use, differentiation, and teacher feedback.",
    "P094": "PLC and Demo Day structures provide recurring opportunities to internalize lessons, anticipate misconceptions, rehearse delivery, and calibrate student evidence before instruction.",
    "P095": "District and campus performance reviews create a recurring structure for identifying off-trajectory grades, student groups, classrooms, and individual students and assigning follow-up actions.",
    "P098": "Grade 3 literacy and mathematics outcomes require accelerated improvement to meet Board expectations.",
    "P100": "Inconsistent fidelity to AIEF, district-provided curriculum, PLC/Demo Day preparation, DOL-driven differentiation, same-day second teach, and coaching creates variability in instructional quality.",
    "P103": "Foundational PK-2 literacy and numeracy must more consistently translate into Grade 3 readiness.",
    "P105": "Progress monitoring, vertical alignment, and targeted acceleration are not yet consistently used to adjust instruction early enough for all students.",
    "P110": "The campus will implement the Beaumont ISD instructional and operational model as the primary structure for improvement rather than treating the CIP as a separate initiative. Instructional work will be organized through the Accelerated Instructional Excellence Framework (AIEF), district-provided curriculum, weekly PLC preparation, Demo Day rehearsal, gradual release, intentional engagement, daily Demonstrations of Learning, purposeful differentiation, same-day second teach/acceleration, Coaching in the Moment, and scored spot observations. Campus leadership will use recurring administrative huddles, performance reviews, attendance routines, and student-support systems to protect instructional time and address implementation barriers. Where the campus is subject to LIP, TIP, or TAP requirements, those requirements will be integrated into this same improvement architecture.",
    "P112": "A common district instructional framework provides clear, observable expectations for classroom practice and adult development.",
    "P113": "Campus leaders have structured routines for PLCs, Demo Day, classroom observation, coaching, administrative huddles, and performance monitoring.",
    "P114": "District support can be differentiated by campus need without requiring campuses to design separate improvement systems.",
    "P117": "Campus improvement depends on consistent implementation of the district instructional model across classrooms, grade levels, and content areas.",
    "P119": "Required routines are not yet implemented with consistent fidelity, frequency, and follow-through in every classroom.",
    "P122": "Improvement planning, intervention requirements, and daily campus work can become fragmented if managed as separate compliance processes.",
    "P124": "CIP/LIP/TIP/TAP requirements, academic monitoring, staffing, attendance, and instructional implementation have not always been managed through one integrated performance-management routine.",
    "P129": "The campus will use student, family, and staff feedback; attendance and engagement indicators; discipline and safety data; family communication records; and available climate/perception measures to understand the experience of the campus community. The district expectation is that students are safe, supported, engaged in learning, and able to develop self-management skills. Family communication should connect directly to attendance, academic progress, behavior expectations, student support, and intervention needs.",
    "P146": "The district has established common expectations for student behavior, family communication, attendance support, and protection of instructional time.",
    "P147": "Campus leaders have multiple channels for gathering student, family, and staff input and for communicating expectations and supports.",
    "P148": "Attendance, behavior, and perception data can be incorporated into recurring campus performance reviews rather than treated as isolated measures.",
    "P151": "Attendance, student engagement, school climate, and stakeholder perception can reduce instructional time and weaken connection to school when concerns are not addressed quickly.",
    "P153": "Attendance outreach, behavior supports, family communication, and student-support follow-up are not yet implemented with sufficient consistency for every student requiring intervention.",

    "P398": "Instructional implementation is not yet sufficiently consistent across classrooms and grade levels.",
    "P399": "Staffing stability, certification, adult effectiveness, and leadership density can constrain the speed and sustainability of improvement.",
    "P400": "Campus monitoring has not always integrated academics, instruction, attendance, staffing, and intervention milestones into one performance-management routine.",
    "P401": "Compliance requirements must reinforce rather than compete with daily instructional improvement.",
    "P463": "SCE resources will supplement the regular education program by providing allowable academic intervention, acceleration, attendance/dropout-prevention support, targeted staffing, tutoring, progress monitoring, and other services for students who are at risk of dropping out or who have not performed satisfactorily on required assessments. SCE-funded supports will be aligned to the campus CNA and the goals/strategies in this CIP. Finance/Federal Programs will validate final program coding, personnel allocations, and supplement-not-supplant requirements.",
    "P465": "District HR/Finance will pre-populate the final personnel roster in Plan4Learning. Campus leaders should validate that assigned SCE-funded personnel are accurately reflected.",
    "P476": "The campus comprehensive needs assessment (CNA) is developed through review of current and historical campus data, including student achievement and growth, attendance, discipline, demographics, staffing, special-program participation, implementation evidence, and stakeholder feedback. Campus leadership reviews multiple measures of data, identifies strengths and problem statements, determines root causes, and prioritizes needs aligned to Beaumont ISD Board Outcome Goals, Elevate Beaumont, and the BISD Instructional Playbook. The CNA informs the campus goals, strategies, resource alignment, and intervention priorities in this plan. Progress is reviewed during quarterly formative reviews and the CNA is refreshed annually using the most current available evidence.",
    "P478": "Evidence of campus planning and stakeholder meetings, including agendas, dates, notes/minutes, and sign-in or attendance documentation, will be maintained in the district-approved Title I documentation repository (Title1Crate, if applicable) and/or the campus improvement-plan evidence folder. The campus principal will ensure documentation is available for district or TEA review upon request.",
    "P480": "The campus plan is developed during the fall planning cycle using district-provided templates, current TEA/accountability data, local campus evidence, and district priorities. District and campus leaders validate campus-specific baselines and targets, review problem statements and root causes, confirm strategies and resources, and complete required stakeholder review before final approval. Quarterly formative reviews are used throughout the year to document implementation status, student progress, barriers, and required adjustments.",
    "P482": "Campus staff, families, community members, and other required stakeholders participate in the campus planning process through the campus-level planning and decision-making structure, public/stakeholder meetings, surveys or feedback opportunities, and review of campus data and proposed improvement priorities. Feedback is used to validate needs, strengthen strategies, and identify barriers to implementation. Required stakeholder lists, roles, and evidence of participation are maintained with campus planning documentation.",
    "P484": "The approved Campus Improvement Plan will be made available to staff, families, and the public through district/campus communication channels and the district website, as applicable. The campus will provide the plan or key information in an understandable and accessible format and will coordinate translation or language access when needed so families can meaningfully understand campus priorities and planned supports.",
    "P486": "The CIP coordinates campus improvement work with applicable federal, state, and local programs and resources, including Title I, State Compensatory Education, Title II, Title III, IDEA, school-improvement funds, student-support services, attendance interventions, and other district initiatives. Where the campus is identified for LIP, TIP, or TAP requirements, those requirements are integrated into the same campus improvement architecture so that compliance activities reinforce rather than compete with daily instructional improvement.",
    "P488": "The strategies in this CIP address the required Title I schoolwide elements through standards-aligned instruction, student progress monitoring, targeted academic intervention and acceleration, teacher/principal quality and development, parent/family engagement, transition supports, services for special populations, discipline monitoring, and coordination of federal/state/local resources. Plan4Learning strategy-level statutory descriptors should be selected to align each strategy with the applicable Title I requirement.",
    "P490": "Program effectiveness will be evaluated through quarterly formative reviews and an annual summative review. Campus leadership will examine student achievement and growth, attendance, discipline, implementation evidence, subgroup outcomes, staffing, stakeholder perception, and other measures aligned to the goals in this plan. Review notes, progress ratings, and assigned follow-up actions will be maintained in Plan4Learning and/or the campus evidence repository. Findings will inform adjustments during the year and the next annual CNA cycle.",
    "P492": "District Federal Programs/HR will pre-populate the final Title I-funded personnel roster in Plan4Learning. Campus leaders should validate assigned personnel, program, position, and FTE.",
    "P504": "This campus will use the same goals, root causes, strategies, and evidence in this CIP to satisfy applicable local or state/federal intervention requirements. Separate compliance fields should not create a different improvement strategy. The campus and district will maintain a single coherent improvement architecture aligned to Board goals, Elevate Beaumont, and the BISD Instructional Playbook.",
    "P515": "The campus will implement intensive curriculum and instruction improvements through the BISD instructional model, including district-provided curriculum, AIEF, structured PLC preparation, Demo Day rehearsal, DOL-driven differentiation, same-day second teach/acceleration, frequent classroom observation and coaching, attendance/student-support routines, and recurring campus performance reviews. These evidence-based interventions are expected to improve identified academic and accountability indicators by strengthening the quality and consistency of Tier 1 instruction, accelerating response to student evidence, and ensuring leaders intervene when implementation or outcomes are off trajectory.",
    "P517": "Progress will be monitored through quarterly formative reviews in Plan4Learning and through more frequent campus operational routines, including weekly PLCs, DOL/common-assessment reviews, classroom observations, attendance/intervention reviews, and campus leadership huddles. Campus and district leaders will review student outcomes, implementation evidence, staffing/attendance indicators, and intervention milestones, document assigned actions, and escalate differentiated support when the campus is off trajectory.",
    "P518": "TIP/TAP-specific assurances, public meeting/hearing documentation, stakeholder evidence, cost/funding information, and final TEA identification indicators will be entered in the dedicated Plan4Learning TIP/TAP module when required.",
    "P521": "The following Plan4Learning areas are completed directly in the application and do not require separate narrative in this Word draft: Plan Checklist, Committees page, and read-only Policies page. The campus should use this document as the copy/paste source for narrative sections and goals, then complete application-only fields and checklists directly in Plan4Learning.",
